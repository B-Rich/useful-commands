Place the cursor on any variable in your program.

gd will take you to the local declaration.
gD will take you to the global declaration.
g* search for the word under the cursor (like *, but g* on 'rain' will find words like 'rainbow').
g# same as g* but in backward direction.
gg goes to the first line in the buffer (or provide a count before the command for a specific line).
G goes to the last line (or provide a count before the command for a specific line).
